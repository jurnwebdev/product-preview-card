## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to use varaible in css. It was amazing having to be using "var(--Value)" instead the regular way of having to write everything in full. One major part i also figured out while working on this project is [background-position]. 
I was having issues with the "background-image" placement while switching from tablet mode to mobile mode. But with the help of w3schools and csstrick, I was able to place the backround image properly as the orientation of the screen changes.


### Continued development

I'm still yet to dive deep into assessibility in html. I used a few while working on this project and I'll keep practicing to improve better on it. Working on a more complex layout next to enhace my mobile first workflow skill.
